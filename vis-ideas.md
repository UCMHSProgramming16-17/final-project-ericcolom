bar graph- easy to see the comparison and easy to understand
histogram- makes it easy to see similarities, but would not work well if the user choses cities thathave large varience in temperature. Also less specific.
heat map- would work very well if the user chose cities that are close to eachother, but would not work well if the user chose cities from different countries.
Scatterplot- Easy to read/understand, but if the user choses some cities with similar temperatures and some with very different temperatures the y axis will be awkwardly skewed.
